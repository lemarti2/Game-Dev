    /* This unity program uses a cylinder object as an fps player
    in order to push spheres into their respective color holes in
    the maze. Cylinder uses a character controller to implement 
    movement and interactions with rigid bodies in the map as well
    as the spheres that need to be pushed. Cylinder also contains a 
    WASD and x axis mouse view rotation to make the movement smoother.
    Collision detectors are used to implement the destruction of spheres
    once they reach their respective color hole. Maze and environment are
    not the most polished ones but I believe the movement is spot on which is
    where I spent most of the time. I was not able to implement a timer or a 
    signal letting the player know the game is over once all balls reach their
    respective holes. 1 script for movement on the player, 1 script for sphere
    deletion on the sphere holes. */
